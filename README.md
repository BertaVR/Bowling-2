# Bowling-2
Este es el kata del Bowling mejorado

## Objetivo

El objetivo de este kata es el de diseñar un código que pueda calcular la puntuación final de una partida de bolos dada su tarjeta de puntuación. Es un kata hecho con fines educativos durante el FP de DAW.


## Instrucciones:
Las instrucciones que nos daban eran las siguientes.

### Lógica del negocio o reglas del juego

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling,
produces the total score for the game. This is a summary of the rules of the game:
- Each game, or “line” of bowling, includes ten turns, or “frames” for the bowler.
- In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all the pins.

- If in two tries, he fails to knock them all down, his score for that frame is the total number of pins
knocked down in his two tries.
- If in two tries he knocks them all down, this is called a “spare” and his score for the frame is ten
plus the number of pins knocked down on his next throw (in his next turn).
- If on his first try in the frame he knocks down all the pins, this is called a “strike”. His turn is over,
and his score for the frame is ten plus the simple total of the pins knocked down in his next two
rolls.
- If he gets a spare or strike in the last (tenth) frame, the bowler gets to throw one or two more
bonus balls, respectively. - These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. If the bonus
throws knock down all the pins, the process does not repeat: the bonus throws are only used to
calculate the score of the final frame.
- The game score is the total of all frame scores.

### Requisitos funcionales: qué NO hace el programa
Here are some things that the program will not do:
- We will not check for valid rolls.
- We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
- We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.

## Agradecimientos
